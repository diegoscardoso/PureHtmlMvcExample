# PureHtmlMvcExample

This is a simple example of how to use the design pattern MVC for an HTML Application. 

MVC is a software architecture design pattern created by Trygve Reenskaug in 1970 and it's been highly used until these days. 

Reenskaug described his early Smalltalk and object-oriented programming conceptual efforts as follows:

"MVC was conceived as a general solution to the problem of users controlling a large and complex data set. The hardest part was to hit upon good names for the different architectural components. Model-View-Editor was the first set. After long discussions, particularly with Adele Goldberg, we ended with the terms Model-View-Controller."

Views = userFormView.html

Model = model/userModel.js

Controller = userFormController.js
